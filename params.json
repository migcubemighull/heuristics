Reference: http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/latest/doc/install.html\r\nIs also necessary the c libraries\r\n\r\n# Running\r\nUnsing the following commands:\r\nmake app1-s1 for scenario with application without heuristics and migrations\r\nmake app1-s2 for scenario with application with heuristics but without migrations\r\nmake app1-s2 for scenario with application with heuristics and with migrations\r\nTo run the application use:\r\n\r\n./migbsp platform_file.xml deployment_file.xml\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis page is supported by the creators of MigBSP, MigHull and MigCube.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
